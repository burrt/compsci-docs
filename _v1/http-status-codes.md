### 2XX Success

| Code                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `200 OK`                            | In a GET request - recv stuff. In a POST - recv result.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `201 Created`                       | The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `202 Accepted`                      | The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not be eventually acted upon, and may be disallowed when processing occurs.                                                               |
| `203 Non-Authoritative Information` | The server is a transforming proxy (e.g. a Web accelerator) that received a `200 OK` from its origin, but is returning a modified version of the origin's response.                                                                                           |
| `204 No Content`                    | The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `205 Reset Content`                 | The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. Unlike a 204 response, this response requires that the requester reset the document view.                                                                                    |
| `206 Partial Content`               | The server is delivering only part of the resource (byte serving) due to a range header sent by the client. <br>The range header is used by HTTP clients to enable resuming of interrupted downloads, or split a download into multiple simultaneous streams. |

### 3XX Redirection

| Code                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `300 Multiple Choices`   | Indicates multiple options for the resource from which the client may choose (via agent-driven content negotiation). For example, this code could be used to present multiple video format options, to list files with different filename extensions, or to suggest word-sense disambiguation.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `301 Moved Permanently`  | This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `302 Found`              | This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"), but popular browsers implemented `302` with the functionality of a `303 See Other`. <br>Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes `303` and `307` to distinguish between the two behaviors. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the `302` status code as if it were the `303`. |
| `303 See Other`          | The response to the request can be found under another URI using a `GET` method. When received in response to a `POST` (or `PUT/DELETE`), the client should presume that the server has received the data and should issue a redirect with a separate `GET` message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `304 Not Modified`       | Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match. <br>In such case, there is no need to retransmit the resource since the client still has a previously-downloaded copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `305 Use Proxy`          | The requested resource is available only through a proxy, the address for which is provided in the response. <br>Many HTTP clients (such as Mozilla and IE) do not correctly handle responses with this status code, primarily for security reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `307 Temporary Redirect` | In this case, the request should be repeated with another URI; however, future requests should still use the original URI. <br>In contrast to how 302 was historically implemented, the request method is not allowed to be changed when reissuing the original request. e.g. a `POST` request should be repeated using another `POST` request.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `308 Permanent Redirect` | The request and all future requests should be repeated using another URI. `307` and `308` parallel the behaviors of `302` and `301`, but do **not** allow the HTTP method to change. <br>So, for example, submitting a form to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### 4XX Client errors

| Code                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `400 Bad Request`       | The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `401 Unauthorized`      | Similar to `403 Forbidden`, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. `401 semantically` means "unauthenticated", i.e. the user does not have the necessary credentials. <br>**Note**: Some sites issue `HTTP 401` when an IP address is banned from the website and that specific address is refused permission to access a website. |
| `402 Payment Required`  | Reserved for future use. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, but that has not yet happened, and this code is not usually used. <br>Google Developers API uses this status if a particular developer has exceeded the daily limit on requests.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `403 Forbidden`         | The request was valid, but the server is refusing action. The user might not have the necessary permissions for a resource, or may need an account of some sort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `404 Not Found`         | The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `408 Request Timeout`   | The server timed out waiting for the request."The client did not produce a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait. The client MAY repeat the request without modifications at any later time."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `413 Payload Too Large` | The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process. Previously called "Request Entity Too Large".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `414 URI Too Long`      | The URI provided was too long for the server to process. Often the result of too much data being encoded as a query-string of a GET request, in which case it should be converted to a POST request.Called "Request-URI Too Long" previously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `500 Internal Server Error`           | A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `501 Not Implemented`                 | The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfil the request. Usually this implies future availability (e.g., a new feature of a web-service API).                                                                              |
| `502 Bad Gateway`                     | The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `503 Service Unavailable`             | The server is currently unavailable (overloadedd/down for maintenance). Generally, this is a temporary state.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `504 Gateway Timeout`                 | The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `505 HTTP Version Not Supported`      | The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `506 Variant Also Negotiates`         | Transparent content negotiation for the request results in a circular reference.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `507 Insufficient Storage`            | The server is unable to store the representation needed to complete the request.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `508 Loop Detected`                   | The server detected an infinite loop while processing the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `510 Not Extended`                    | Further extensions to the request are required for the server to fulfil it.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `511 Network Authentication Required` | The client needs to authenticate to gain network access. Intended for use by intercepting proxies used to control access to the network (e.g., "captive portals" used to require agreement to Terms of Service before granting full Internet access via a Wi-Fi hotspot). |
