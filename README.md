# Computer Science Notes

A collection of Computer Science and Engineering notes I've jotted down across the years. 
I thought I'd use Jekyll to organize and view these notes as they're starting to grow quickly.

## In-browser viewing

These docs can be viewed at https://burrt.github.io/compsci-docs/.

### Building

Setup and install [Jekyll](#https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), then run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
